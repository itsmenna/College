# Adaptive-Huffman-Coding
Adaptive Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms implemented using java. 
The project has a user interface which allows the user to choose a text file with the string to be compressed. Then a compressed file is created in the same directory of the original file. The same thing happens with decompressing. The compressed file is chosen by the user and the decompressed file is created in the same directory.
